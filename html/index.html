            <p>Booktique is an ambitious, highly-driven start-up company with over 2,500 active users annually. We are seeking assistance in developing a database for our website to help users track their reading progress, share their book collection, and rate books they have read. The website's database will store users' personal data, book details, and their interactions with the 1,000 available books to browse. Features such as: displaying the books they have read, putting books on their wishlist, and dropping books they are no longer interested in are key for creating a personalized user experience. Another requirement is the need to categorize books by author and genre to make browsing our website efficient and easy for our users. This system is designed to handle user interactions on a scale of thousands of users and books per year, with expectations for outstanding growth.</p>
